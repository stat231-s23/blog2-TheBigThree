# Intro

This is an R Markdown blog templatej. This document will be knit to HTML to produce a webpage that will be hosted publicly via GitHub.

## Website publication work flow

1.  Edit Rmd

2.  Knit to HTML to view progress. You may need to click "Open in Browser" for some content to show (sometimes content won't show until you actually push your changes to GitHub and view the published website).

3.  Commit and push changes when you are ready. The website may take a couple minutes to update automatically after the push, but you may need to clear your browser's cache or view the page in a private/incognito window to see the changes more quickly.

# Bar Chart

```{r, fig.cap='"Man City"', out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/bar-graph.png") 
```

# Table

```{r table-app, out.width = "250%", out.extra = 'data-external="1" frameborder="no"', fig.cap = "[Data Science Premier League Table Shiny App](https://michaelp.shinyapps.io/table/)"}
knitr::include_app("https://michaelp.shinyapps.io/table/",
                   height = "800px")
```

# Network

```{r network-app, out.width = "250%", out.extra = 'data-external="1" frameborder="no"', fig.cap = "[Data Science Premier League Network Shiny App](https://michaelp.shinyapps.io/networkGraph/)"}
knitr::include_app("https://michaelp.shinyapps.io/networkGraph/",
                   height = "800px")
```

# Formatting

## Clusters {.tabset}

Each subsection below the "Tabbed subsections" section heading will appear in a tab. See R Markdown Cookbook [Section 7.6: Put content in tabs](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-tabs.html) for additional customization options.

### Goals Scored v.s Percentage Wins

```{r, fig.cap='"1"', out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/img-1.png") 
```

### Goals Conceded v.s Percentage Wins

```{r, fig.cap='"2"', out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/img-2.png")
```

### Goals Scored v.s Goals Conceded

```{r, fig.cap='"3"', out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/img-3.png")
```

# References

All data sources, any key R packages, and any other sources used in developing your blog should be cited in full in a list of references at the end of your blog. Your blog post should also link to these sources as they are discussed. You may choose any reference style as long as sources are fully cited (try to be consistent!).

Typically, references in R Markdown (and LaTeX) files are [incorporated with a BibTeX database](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html) (a .bib file). You can try this approach or manually include either a numbered or alphabetized list.

Columbia University has compiled some guidance on [how to cite data](https://guides.library.columbia.edu/datacitation). Some data sources will give you the citation information to copy and paste. Use the provided citations or citation styles in those cases.

You can list R package citations with the code `citation("packageName")` in the console and then copy (and reformat as needed) the relevant text, e.g.,

```{r}
citation("DT")
```

The following citations are based on the American Statistical Association citation style (not all of these references are used in this document).:
